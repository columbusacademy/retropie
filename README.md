# retropie
This repository is a group of python projects for RetroPie arcade, upon Pull Request to 'main' branch, code will attempt to auto deploy to retropie arcade.

This project is a learning experience in collabrative coding.

# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first communicate your intent with retropie@columbusacademy.org

Steps in being a good collabrative coder include the following – all changes should be made by creating a feature branch from main.  Once you have tested your code changes in your feature branch and feel they are ready for the arcade, submit a pull request to main and one of the branch approvers will review and merge your code, which will kick off an automated deployment to the arcade.

If you would like to improve this process or become a branch approver, please reach out to retropie@columbusacademy.org

## Workflow:
* Define your intent (changing the audio for a game, changing the graphics, writing a new game, fixing a bug, improving the readme docs, etc)
* Email retropie@columbusacademy.org
* Create a feature branch for your efforts
* Clone the branch to your computer 
* Open the code in your favorite IDE (MU, Visual Studio Code, etc)
* Make your changes, then run your code locally, test to make sure everything works!
* Consider how keyboard input may change to joystick/button input on the arcade and ensure you handle that in your code gracefully
* Create a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch
* Code will be automatically deployed to the arcade for testing (this feature coming soon).

## How to create a branch
[GitHub Guide for Creating a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)

Consider keeping branch name short with clear intent.  Prefix branch name with things like feature or bugFix to help identify the goal the branch is solving.

## How to make a pull request

[GitHub Guide for Creating a Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

Please make sure to test your code locally and provide adequate context in your pull request comments.

## GitHub clients options

There are several options, from GitHub Desktop, IDE integrated clients, CLI based clients to simply using a web browser.  This is largely preference and workflow based, I suggest starting simple or asking others what they prefer and why.
